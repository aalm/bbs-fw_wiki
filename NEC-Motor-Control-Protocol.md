The bbshd-fw firmware only replaces the firmware on the main STC microcontroller.  
The firmware for the additional NEC 79F9211, which implements BLDC motor control  
and exports a simplified interface for control, is thus untouched.

# Serial Protocol

The two microcontrollers communicates directly using an asynchronous serial line.  
Baud rate is 4800.

The protocol follows similar principles of the the display protocol.

Rules:
* All messages start with 0xAA
* Last byte is checksum which is the sum of all previous bytes (excluding 0xAA) truncated to 8 bits.

STC MCU issues requests and NEC MCU responds, nothing is sent by NEC without a request.


## Initialization

STC MCU continuously resends first initialization command until NEC responds which takes a few tries.  
During initialization the requests are echoed as response.

Note: In table below the leading message header "AA" and trailing checksum has been left out.

Request  | Response | Interpretation
-------- | -------- | --------------
67 00    | 67 00    | Probably just a "hello" message,
68 5A    | 68 5A    | Set parameter? Value 0x5A
69 11    | 69 11    | Set parameter? Value 0x11
6A 78    | 6A 78    | Set parameter? Value 0x78
6B 64    | 6B 64    | Set parameter? Value 0x64
6C 50    | 6C 50    | Set parameter? Value 0x50
6D 46    | 6D 46    | Set parameter? Value 0x46
6E 0C    | 6E 0C    | Set parameter? Value 0x0C
60 02 56 | 60 02 56 | Set low voltage cutoff limit 41V. See status request 42.
61 CF    | 61 CF    | Set battery max current limit 30A. See status request 41.

The parameters which have not been identified above are hardcoded in the standard firmware to these values.  
It could potentially be motor parameters for FOC or current ramp up/down etc. I have no clue and have not  
performed any further investigation.

## Commands

Note: In table below the leading message header "AA" and trailing checksum has been left out.

Request  | Response | Interpretation
-------- | -------- | --------------
63 XX    | 63 XX    | Target Speed (0 - 255)
64 XX    | 64 XX    | Target Current % (0 - 100), percent of max current


## Status
Status requests are sent frequently by the STC MCU.
There seems to be 3 types of request.

Note: In table below the leading message header "AA" and trailing checksum has been left out.

Request  | Response | Interpretation
-------- | -------- | --------------
40       | 40 XX XX | Status/error flags.
41       | 41 XX    | ADC Battery Current (6.9 steps per amp)
42       | 42 XX XX | ADC Battery voltage (14.8 steps per volt measured)


### Status Flags

#### Byte 1

B7 | B6 | B5                | B4 | B3                 | B2                     | B1 | B0
-- | -- | ----------------- | -- | ------------------ | ---------------------- | -- | --------------------
 ? | ?  | Hall Sensor Fault | ?  | Low Voltage Cutoff | Motor Ctrl Disabled    | ?  | Brake
 
 #### Byte 2

B7 | B6 | B5 | B4 | B | B2                   | B1 | B0
-- | ---| -- | -- | - | -------------------- | -- | --
 ? | ?  | ?  | ?  | ? | Current Sense Fault  | ?  | ?

Bit 7 of byte 2 is set initially on startup if current sense error is present. Cleared when motor move signal is received leaving only current sense error. There is supposed to be a motor phase error code according to the display error list but I cannot triggers it in any way to find it.
It might not be present on the BBS line or the fault detection was implemented in the STC microcontroller.
